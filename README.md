# CS-A150-HW03
Write a program that translates a letter grade into a numeric
grade point.

Letter grades are A, B, C, D, and F, possibly followed by + or –. Their numeric
values are 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0. In our scheme, there is no F+ or F–, or A+. Adding a +
to the grade increases the numeric value by 0.3, a – decreases it by 0.3.
